# Redfish® Server for Intel® Infrastructure Processing Unit SoC E2100

This repository contains the source code for the Redfish Server for the Intel Internet Processing Unit (IPU) SoC E2100.
This is an official public release mirror repository.

The current `main` branch contains the full release code. To build it, you need to obtain a copy of the Intel IPU software development kit (SDK), available 
under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The Intel IPU SDK contains additional components, the build environment, and guidelines on how to build and run the IPU Redfish Server.
For more information, please refer [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/822607/enable-intel-ipu-e2100-with-intel-ipu-soc-e2100-software.html).

If you do not have the IPU SDK, you can build and test a reduced version of Redfish code with proprietary components excluded. 
You can find it at the [compilable-main](https://github.com/intel/ipu-redfish/tree/compilable-main) branch.
